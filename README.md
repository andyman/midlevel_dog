This is game jam code, and game jam level design stuff. It was made in a hurry as throwaway code, with no thought towards usability or optimization. Do not use this stuff for production purposes for your real games. Do not even use this as an example of what to do. It is a complete mess under the hood so that it could be made quickly for the game jam.
